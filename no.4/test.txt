ANNABEL LEE 

It was many and many a year ago， 
In a kingdom by the sea， 
That a maiden there lived whom you may know 
By the name of ANNABEL LEE； 
And this maiden she lived with no other thought 
Than to love and be loved by me. 

She was a child and I was a child，In this kingdom by the sea； 
But we loved with a love that was more than love I and my Annabel Lee； 
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven Coveted her and me. 
And this was the reason that， 
long ago，In this kingdom by the sea， 
A wind blew out of a cloud by night chilling my Annabel Lee； 
So that her highborn kinsman came And bore her away from me， 
To shut her up in a sepulchre In this kindom by the sea. 

The angels ，not half so happy in the heaven， 
Went evnying her and me Yes！ 
That was the reason 
（as all men know， in this kingdom by the sea） 
That the wind came out of the cloud，Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. 

But our love it was stronger by far than the love 
Of those who were older than we 
Of many far wiser than we 
And neither the angels in heaven above， 
Nor the demons down under the sea， 
Can ever dissever my soulfrom the soul Of the beautiful Annabel Lee. 

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams Of the beautiful Annalbel Lee； 
And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes Of the beautiful Annabel Lee； 
And so，all the night-tide ， 
I lie down by the side Of my darling ， 
my darling，my life and my bride， 
In the sepulchre there by the sea， 
In her tomb by the side of the sea. 

t Time Of Year Thou Mayst In Me Behold 

William Shakespere

That time of year thou mayst in me behold

When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang

Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,

bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.

In me thou see'st the twilight of such day

as after sunset fadeth in the west;

which by and by black night doth take away,

death's second self, that seals all up in rest.

In me thou see'st the golwing of such fire,

that on the ashes of his youth doth lie,

as the death-bed whereon it must expire,

consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.

This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,

to love that well which thou must leave ere long.
